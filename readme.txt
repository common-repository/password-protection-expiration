Allows you to easily change the lifetime of the WordPress cookie which allows
automatic login to password-protected posts.

== Description ==
When you password-protect a post in WordPress, a cookie is set to expire in 10
days which prevents the user from having to enter the password during that
10-day period. This plugin allows you to easily change the lifetime of that
cookie.


== Installation ==
Unzip into wp-content/plugins, then activate via the admin panel. Settings are
in Settings -> Password-Protection Expiration.

== Changelog ==
0.2 - Added settings page; expiration time now based on a WordPress option.

0.1 - Defaults to 2 hours
